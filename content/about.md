## HiðŸ‘‹ I am Rajul
### aka (@rajuljha)

I am a passionate software engineer from India. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Aligarh Muslim 
University. My love for technology and innovation drives me to constantly learn and create.

I have 1+ years of experience in Backend Development (Django, Spring Boot mostly), I have been a part of
Google Summer of Code '24 and '25 [@FOSSology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology). I have interned at a silicon valley based startup [@Support Vectors AI Labs](https://supportvectors.ai) and a hyderabad startup called NextDNA Edutech where I worked on [CuriousAtoms](https://www.curiousatoms.com)

Checkout my [Blog](https://rajuljha.github.io/posts) page to for my experiences during GSoC or just read me writing my opinion on tech.

### Interests and Activities

- **Backend:** Backend development is my forte. I enjoy building robust and scalable systems that solve real-world problems. My core tech stack is Python, Django, PostgreSQL. Recently, I have delved into Java and Spring Boot and have built some cool [projects](https://rajuljha.github.io/projects) around it!
- **Open Source:** I actively create and contribute to open source projects. I believe in the power of collaborative development and the freedom it brings to software creation. I actively contribute to [fossology](https://github.com/fossology) and like to make and break open source tech in my day to day life.
- **Conferences:** I love participating in hackathons and attending conferences and talks about programming and software. Recently, I have gotten the opportunity to present my work at [PyCon India '25](https://cfp.in.pycon.org/2025/talk/ZCLJ7U/). I am keen to make it impactful. I have attended numerous conferences in the past including PyDelhi and OOSC IITK.
- **Community Building:** I co-founded an open source community at my college called **[ZHCET Code Oasis](https://zhcet-code-oasis.vercel.app)**. Our mission is to foster a culture of open source contribution and collaboration among students.
